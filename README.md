# Playrr

Open source audio playrr!  
No illegal technical tricks, so completely legal!  
No audio adds :D  

## Wiki

* [Playrr installers](wiki/download_links.md)
* [How to build](wiki/how_to_build.md)
* [Installing Playrr](wiki/install_playrr.md) 


## Beta

It's very **beta**, which means that its fare from a bug-free product.  
Use it with this in mind (and help or [create an issue](https://github.com/MatthijsKamstra/playrr/issues)).

## Limitations

- Artist you are looking for must be on Spotify.
- Top track from that artist needs to be on Youtube.
- Internet connection (you need to stream all those videos)

## With a little help

- [Haxe](http://www.haxe.org) obviously! (Haxe is awesome! One codebase, many targets, no platform specific code.)
- Spotify artist search and most popular tracks
- Youtube for the music (videos)
