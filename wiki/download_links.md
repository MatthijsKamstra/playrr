# Download links

Currently I have the files hosted by Google Drive.  
Github has a 100MB limit for files, so the installers couldn't be hosted here.

I am not happy about the current solution I use: the installers are hosted on Google Drive. The size of the files are so large that you will get a warning that Google Drive can't scan the files against viruses.

But it was a quick solution.   
**If someone has a better solution, just let me know.** 

If you don't trust me, you can always build these files yourself. Everything is build with open source software; just follow the instructions.
