# Install Playrr

I try to make this as easy as I can, but have limited resources so I haven't tested it on Windows or Linux.

* [Installing on Windows](#install-windows)

## Install OSX

To make the install of Playrr smoother, I need a license from Apple.  
Don't have that (yet), so we need to make sure your highly tuned OSX allows us to install the app. Follow the instructions below (till the last point) 

1. Download the installer [`Playrr.dmg`](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B71bEuxrm-kDM0ZZekIwVFRKYkU/view?usp=sharing)
2. Open "System preferences" ([1](#install1))
	- Click on "Security & Privacy" 
3. Choose tab "General" ([2](#install2))
	- Click on lock at the bottom left: "Click the lock to make changes"
	- Change "Allow apps downloaded from" to "Anywhere"
	- Keep this window open
4. Now open the `Playrr.dmg` you downloaded and drag the Playrr icon in the `Applications` folder
5. Kablammmm you are a brand new `Playrr` user, thank you!
6. **Important:** Go back to the "Security & Privacy" 
	- **Change "Allow apps downloaded from" back to "Mac App Store and identified developers" or stricter.**

## Install Windows

I have made an installer you can download here: 

[Windows 64 bit (Playrr setup.exe)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B71bEuxrm-kDZDFMcTRLQmk1ZDQ/view?usp=sharing)

[Windows 32 bit (Playrr setup.exe)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B71bEuxrm-kDbW1mTmh3RXA1d1k/view?usp=sharing)

It should work like it normally does.
**Let me know if it doesn't**

## Install Linux

Currently I have no way of creating installers for Linux. But that is probably because Linux users are more tech-savy.
You probably know what to do with these files:
